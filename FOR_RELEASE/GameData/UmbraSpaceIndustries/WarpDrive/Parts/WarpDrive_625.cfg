description = Takes you places.  Or rather, takes the place to you.  Runs on exotic matter, produced by the built in reactor core.  Note:  You will need a significant amount of ElectricCharge to convert to Exotic Matter.  Also, due to the nature of the warp field, anything outside of it (other ships, parts of your own ship) will explode.
